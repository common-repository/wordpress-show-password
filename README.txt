By adding a checkbox on the WordPress Login Screen your users can decide whether they want their password field masked or not.

== Description ==

Based on [Show Password](http://andreaslagerkvist.com/jquery/show-password/), a simple jQuery-plugin by Andreas Lagerkvist. By adding a "Show Password" checkbox on the WordPress Login Screen users can decide whether they want their password field masked or not.

*"Usability suffers when users type in passwords and the only feedback they get is a row of bullets. Typically, masking passwords doesn’t even increase security, but it does cost you business due to login failures."* – Jacob Nielsen, Stop password masking.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin (WordPress Show Password) through 'Plugins > Installed'.


== Screenshots ==
